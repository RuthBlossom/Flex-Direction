# Flex Direction

This HTML document demonstrates the use of the `flex-direction` property in CSS to control the direction of flex items within a flex container. The flex items are arranged in a column layout.

## Features

- **Flex Container**: The `<div>` element with the class `container` serves as the flex container.
- **Flex Items**: Seven `<div>` elements with different background colors represent the flex items.
- **Styling**: Each flex item is styled with a distinct background color for visual differentiation.
- **Border**: The flex container has a golden-colored border.

## Flex Direction

- The flex container uses the `flex-direction: column;` property to arrange its child items in a vertical column layout.
- This means that the flex items are stacked vertically from top to bottom within the container.
